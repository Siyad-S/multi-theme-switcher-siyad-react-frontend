Multi-Theme Switcher
Siyad S – React Frontend Developer

## Description

The Multi-Theme Switcher App is a React-based web application that allows users to toggle between three visually distinct themes. Each theme not only changes colors but also modifies fonts, spacing, structure, and layout, giving users a unique browsing experience. The app fetches product data from an external API and demonstrates responsive design, state management, and theme persistence.

## Tech Stack

# React + Vite – Fast and optimized frontend development

# TypeScript – Strongly typed code for reliability

# Three Distinct Themes
